C Phone directory Manager 
This is was my first ever coding project , used C windows gui .
Allowing the user to create his own directory list containing name , phone number address email etc . adding input control so they enter correct format for email / number,birthday date .
after that it gets saved to a .txt file in same repos and one of the controls allow the user to open the .txt file.
One of the tabs in the windows application , allowing users to search / add / delete /edit new informations in the directory list and save them to same file .
